### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd)/appliedchem-3624702:/opt/notebooks ml-environment
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}\appliedchem-3624702:/opt/notebooks ml-environment
```

## üìì Accessing Jupyter Notebook
